## Overview
AutoTrack is an advanced Max patch, executing real-time video analysis and concurrently synthesizing correlated, multi-layered soundscapes. 
It allows users to manipulate these layers during the generation process. This programme fosters a dynamic and customizable audio-visual correlation.

## Dataflow
Video analysis encompasses several aspects that are commonly employed in the field. These aspects include color picking and tracking, blob tracking, distance transform calculation, and matrix histogram calculation.
